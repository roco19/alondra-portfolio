<!-- 
Create a responsive landing page for an artist portfolio using HTML and TailwindCSS.

Requirements:
- Responsive layout that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Supports light and dark mode, with a toggle button in the header to switch themes.
  By default, the theme should follow the device's system preference (prefers-color-scheme).
- Minimalist, clean, and creative style with plenty of white space and clear hierarchy.

Structure:
1. Header:
   - Artist name/logo on the left.
   - Navigation links (Home, Portfolio, About, Contact) on the right.
   - Theme toggle button (light/dark) in the header.

2. Hero section:
   - Large centered heading with artist’s name.
   - Short tagline or description below.
   - Optionally a placeholder image or artwork.

3. Portfolio section:
   - Grid layout to showcase artworks (paintings, sketches, sculptures).
   - Thumbnails that could expand or link (use placeholders for now).

4. About section:
   - Short text block with placeholder for artist’s photo and bio.

5. Testimonials / Press section:
   - Minimal cards with quotes or publication logos (use placeholders).

6. Contact section:
   - Simple form (Name, Email, Message).
   - Links to social media icons.

7. Footer:
   - Minimal footer with copyright.

Use Tailwind utility classes for spacing, typography, and responsiveness.
Keep the design minimal and modern.

Follow the best coding practices and structure.
