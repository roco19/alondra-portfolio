Create a minimal, clean, and creative landing page wireframe for an artist portfolio. 
The layout should feel elegant and modern, with plenty of white space and simple visual hierarchy. 

Requirements:
- The page must be responsive, adapting to different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). 
- Include both light and dark mode themes. Add a toggle button in the header to switch between themes. By default, the theme should follow the device’s system preference.

Sections to include:
- Header with artist name/logo on the left and simple navigation links on the right (Home, Portfolio, About, Contact). Include the light/dark theme toggle button here. 
- Hero section: large centered text with the artist's name and a short tagline. Optionally include a placeholder for a background image or artwork. 
- Portfolio gallery section: grid layout to showcase artworks (paintings, sketches, sculptures), with space for thumbnails that can expand or link to details. 
- About section: short text block with artist’s photo placeholder and biography. 
- Testimonials or press section: minimal cards with quotes or logos of publications/exhibitions. 
- Contact section: simple form (name, email, message) and/or links to social media. 
- Footer: copyright and minimalist links.

Overall style: minimalist, creative, plenty of negative space, typography-focused, subtle artistic touches without clutter.
